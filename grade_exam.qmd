Preliminary and question 1:

```{r}
#| message: false
here::i_am("grade.Rproj")
library(here)
library(ggplot2)
library(vroom)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
grade <- read_delim("grades.csv")
```

Question 2:

Since each row have a grade, we can use the following code

```{r}
nrow(grade)
```

The data set contains 40 836 grades.

Question 3:

```{r}
grade |>
distinct(id) |>
nrow() 
```

The number of students in the dataset is 716.

Question 4:



```{r}
students <- grade |>
 group_by(id,group) |>
 distinct(id, .keep_all = TRUE)
  
```


```{r}
students |>
slice_tail(n = 5) |>
knitr::kable()

```

Question 5:

```{r}
ggplot(students, aes(group)) +
  geom_bar()
```
